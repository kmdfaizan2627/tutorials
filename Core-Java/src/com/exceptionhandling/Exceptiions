Throwable class is the root class for all exceptions in Java.
The Throwable class is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in the Java language.
The exception class is a subclass of the Throwable class.

Exception is (derived class/child class) of Throwable class.

Error vs Exceptions
Errors can not be handled through program. Example - Examples include OutOfMemoryError 
and StackOverflowError

Exceptions can be handled through program.

Exception class is the superclass for most of the exceptions.

  1. Runtime Exception(Unchecked Exception)
  2. Compile Time Exception(Checked Exception)
  
Runtime Exception
These exceptions are not checked at compile time. They usually represent programming errors, 
and it's generally considered good practice to handle them through proper coding rather than 
catching them explicitly.
ArithmeticException: Arithmetic error, such as division by zero.
NullPointerException: Attempt to access an object with a null reference.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Array index is out of bounds.
IllegalArgumentException: Indicates that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate 
argument.
ClassCastException: Invalid cast.
NumberFormatException: Invalid conversion of a string to a numeric format.
... and others.


Checked Exceptions (Compile Time Exception)
These exceptions must be either caught or declared to be thrown. They are typically external to
 the program and cannot be anticipated by the compiler.
IOException: Signals that an I/O exception has occurred.
SQLException: An exception that provides information on a database access error or other errors.
FileNotFoundException: Signals that an attempt to open the file denoted by a specified pathname 
has failed.
ParseException: Thrown to indicate that the parse operation has failed.
... and others.
