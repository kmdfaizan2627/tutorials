1.List Interface:   // Important
Represents an ordered collection of elements.
Common implementations include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.

ArrayList-
ArrayList is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is found in the java.util package. It
implements the List interface and provides a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size as 
elements are added or removed.

ArrayList can initially store up to 10 elements without needing to resize its internal array.
0.75f is the load factor.

Creating an ArrayList:
ArrayList<Data Type> list = new ArrayList<>();

Adding Elements in ArrayList:
list.add("Element 1");
list.add("Element 2");
list.add("Element 3");

Accessing element of an ArrayList:
String element = list.get(1); // Inside get method we put index
System.out.println(element);  // Output: Element 2
-> It means with the help of index we can directly search an element.

Iterating over ArrayList
for (String item : list) {
    System.out.println(item);
}


Removing Element from ArrayList:
list.remove("Element 2");

To get size of ArrayList -
int size = list.size();
System.out.println("Size of ArrayList: " + size);

Other Operations:
ArrayList provides various methods for other operations like checking if it contains an element,
finding the index of an element, clearing the list, etc.
boolean containsElement = list.contains("Element 1");
int indexOfElement = list.indexOf("Element 3");
list.clear();
