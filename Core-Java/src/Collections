Collection
It comes under java.util package.
A collection is an object that represents a group of objects, known as elements. 
Java provides a framework called the Java Collections Framework, which is a set of classes and 
interfaces that provide commonly reusable collection data structures. These collections can be
used to store, manipulate, and retrieve groups of objects. The Java Collections Framework 
includes interfaces such as List, Set, Queue, and Map, along with their various implementations..
Here are some key interfaces and classes in the Java Collections Framework:
List Interface:
Represents an ordered collection of elements.
Common implementations include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.

1.List Interface:   // Important
Represents an ordered collection of elements.
Common implementations include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.

2.Set Interface: // Important
Represents a collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
Common implementations include HashSet and TreeSet.

3.Queue Interface:
Represents a collection designed for holding elements before processing.
Common implementations include LinkedList and PriorityQueue.

4.Map Interface:  // Important
Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
Common implementations include HashMap and TreeMap.

5.Collections Class:
Contains static utility methods for operating on collections.
Provides methods for sorting, searching, and other common operations.

6.Iterators:  // Important
All collections provide an iterator that allows iterating over the collection of elements.
