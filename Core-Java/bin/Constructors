Constructor 
-> a constructor is a special type of method used to initialize objects of a class.
It has the same name as the class and is called automatically when an object is 
created.Constructors play a crucial role in setting up the initial state of an object.

There are two types of constructors-
1.Default Constructor:
If you don't define any constructor in your class, Java provides a default
constructor with no parameters.
It is also called non- parameterized constructor.
Example-
public class MyClass {
    public MyClass(){
    // Default constructor is automatically created by JVM if not defined
    }
}

2.Parameterized Constructors:
Constructors with parameters are called Parameterized constructors.
It allow us to initialize class object with properties with their values during 
object creation.
Example - 
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    // Parameterized constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
