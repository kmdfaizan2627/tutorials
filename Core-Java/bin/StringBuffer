StringBuffer is a class in Java that provides a mutable(change) sequence of characters.
It is synchronized, making it thread-safe.
You can append, insert, delete, and modify content in a StringBuffer.
It has methods for converting to a String, getting length and capacity, and more.
It is less efficient than StringBuilder in single-threaded scenarios due to 
synchronization.
If thread safety is not a concern, it's often recommended to use StringBuilder for 
better performance in single-threaded environments.

public class StringBufferExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a StringBuffer with an initial value
        StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer("Hello");

        // Appending text to the StringBuffer
        stringBuffer.append(" World");
        System.out.println("Result: " + stringBuffer.toString());
        }
   }
   Output- Hello World
   Only one object is here
