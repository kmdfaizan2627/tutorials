Dispatcher Servlet
Dispatcher Servlet is also called as Front Controller
The DispatcherServlet is a central servlet in the Spring MVC framework that receives incoming client
requests and dispatches them to the appropriate handler for processing. It acts as the front 
controller in the Spring MVC architecture, managing the flow of requests and responses.

Handler Mapping
In Spring MVC, Handler Mapping is a crucial component responsible for mapping incoming HTTP requests
 to the appropriate handler (controller) within the application. It plays a vital role in 
 determining which controller should process a specific request based on the request URL.

DAO layer - Data Access Object layer
Dispatcher Servlet -> Handler Mapping -> Controller -> Models (Repository/Service Layer (DAO layer)->
 Controller -> View
 
 Dispatcher Servlet
 In Spring Boot, the DispatcherServlet is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, 
 identifying the appropriate controller, executing controller methods, and managing the overall
 request-response lifecycle. It plays a key role in mapping requests to controllers, handling 
 exceptions, and coordinating the view resolution and rendering process.  
 
 
 @PostMapping -> When we want to save a new object..
 @GetMapping -> When we want to get data from database..
 @PutMapping -> When we want to update object data in database
 @DeleteMapping -> When we want to delete data/Object 
 
 @Autowired
 This annotation is used to get object reference.
 In core java we were doing like
 Employee obj = new Employee();
 but in springboot we do like
 
 @Autowired
 Employee obj;
 It will provide Employee object reference.
 
 -------------
 When we annotate a class with @Component  then we can call that class object/bean reference with the
 help of @Autowired anywhere in application
 
 @Component
 @Component in Spring,  declaring a class as a Spring bean, and 
 it will be managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. 

 
 @Respository
 This annotation is same as @Component ,declaring a class as a Spring bean, and 
 it will be managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container
 but in addition to that it provide us database related exceptions also
 
 @Controller
 This annotation is same as @Component, declaring a class as a Spring bean, and 
 it will be managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container
 but in addition to that it provide us it provide us mapping of urls.
 
 @RestController
 @Controller + @ResponseBody
 The @RestController annotation is a specialization of @Controller and is introduced in 
 Spring 4.0. It is used to define RESTful web services.
 @Controller is typically used for traditional web applications.
 
 @Service 
 This annotation is same as @Component,declaring a class as a Spring bean, and 
 it will be managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container
 Both  @Service and @Component is interchangeable.
 
@Configuration
Indicates that the class declares one or more @Bean methods and may be 
processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests.

@ComponentScan: Tells Spring to scan and discover other components (such as controllers, 
services, and repositories) in the package where the main class is located and its sub-packages.

@EnableAutoConfiguration: Automatically configures the Spring application based on the 
project's dependencies. It attempts to guess and configure beans that you are likely to need 
based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.

@Bean
In Spring Boot, @Bean is an annotation used to declare a method as a bean definition. When
applied to a method within a configuration class, it indicates to the Spring IoC container 
that the method should be used to create and configure a bean. The bean is then managed by the
Spring container, and its lifecycle is controlled by the container.

Important -
In the context of the Spring Framework, a "bean" refers to a Java object that is managed by the
 Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. The IoC container is responsible for creating, 
 configuring, and managing these beans throughout their lifecycle. Beans are the fundamental 
 building blocks of a Spring application and represent the components that make up the
 application's architecture.
